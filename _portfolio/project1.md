- **Multi-source Data**: Integrates TMDB current movies with MovieLens historical ratings
- **Smart Filtering**: Automatically extracts genres, runtime, ratings, and year preferences
- **Real Events Detection**: Identifies requests for movies based on true stories

**Technical Architecture:**
- **Frontend**: Streamlit interactive chat interface
- **Vector Database**: ChromaDB for fast similarity search
- **Embeddings**: OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002 for semantic understanding
- **LLM**: GPT-3.5-turbo for intelligent response generation
- **APIs**: TMDB API integration for current movie data
- **Data Processing**: Advanced preprocessing pipeline for rich movie descriptions

**Example Queries:**
- "Find me a horror movie based on real events with runtime under 2 hours"
- "Recommend recent sci-fi movies with high ratings"
